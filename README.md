# Ramadan_Challenge

## Introduction
Ramadan is a holy month in Islam. It is the month all Muslims fast and attempt to get closer to Allah, one of the names of God in Arabic

## How to use
- During the day, mark down the chart as you go along.
- Read four (4) pages of Quran after each prayer for a total of 20 per day. That would get you to 600 pages in the 30 days of Ramadan. The last 4 pages can be completed in Taraweeh or sunnah prayers
- Tasbeeh is a form of Zikr or remembrance of Allah with the beads
- Pray Tahajjud as soon as you wake up for suhor (the meal before Fajr)
